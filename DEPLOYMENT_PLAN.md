# Hotel Management Toolbox: Deployment & CI/CD Plan

This document provides a step-by-step plan to deploy the hotel management toolbox app so it is accessible via the internet, and to set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment. Follow each step in order for a secure, maintainable, and extensible deployment.

---

## 1. Decide on Deployment Model
- [ ] Choose deployment type:
  - [x] Web API Service (recommended)
  - [ ] Demo Web App (optional)
  - [ ] Self-hosted or Cloud (choose provider: AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)

## 2. Prepare the Application for Deployment
- [ ] Ensure toolbox server runs as a long-lived process (Docker, systemd, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm all configuration is via environment variables or config files
- [ ] Add production-ready logging and error handling

## 3. Containerize the Application (Recommended)
- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the toolbox server
- [ ] (Optional) Create a `docker-compose.yml` for toolbox + PostgreSQL

## 4. Provision Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up a managed PostgreSQL database (RDS, Cloud SQL, etc.) or self-host
- [ ] Provision an app server (cloud VM, container service, or PaaS)
- [ ] Register a domain or subdomain (e.g., toolbox.apexory.ai)

## 5. Deploy the Toolbox Server
- [ ] Build and push Docker image to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy the container to your infrastructure
- [ ] Set environment variables for production
- [ ] Expose the HTTP port (e.g., 5001) to the internet (with access controls)

## 6. Secure the Deployment
- [ ] Set up HTTPS (TLS) via reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, or cloud load balancer)
- [ ] Restrict access to sensitive endpoints (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords for database and environment variables
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities

## 7. (Optional) Build a Demo Web Frontend
- [ ] Create a simple web app (React, Next.js, Flask, etc.) to interact with the toolbox API
- [ ] Deploy the frontend to a static host (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) or as a subdomain

## 8. Integrate with apexory.ai Website
- [ ] Add a "Live Demo" or "Sample Project" link to your deployed toolbox app
- [ ] (Optional) Embed the demo app in an iframe or as a subdomain (e.g., demo.apexory.ai)

## 9. Set Up CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions (or another CI/CD platform) for:
  - [ ] Automated testing (unit, integration) on every push and PR
  - [ ] Linting and code quality checks
  - [ ] Building Docker images on main branch merges
  - [ ] Pushing Docker images to a registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, etc.)
  - [ ] Automated deployment to your cloud provider or server
- [ ] Store secrets (API keys, DB passwords) securely in GitHub Actions secrets or your cloud provider's secret manager
- [ ] Monitor CI/CD runs and fix any failing builds or deployments

## 10. Monitor and Maintain
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring (Grafana, Datadog, or cloud-native tools)
- [ ] Set up automated database backups
- [ ] Monitor for errors, performance, and security issues

## 11. Document Everything
- [ ] Update README and website with deployment instructions, API docs, and demo links
- [ ] Provide clear instructions for contributors and users
